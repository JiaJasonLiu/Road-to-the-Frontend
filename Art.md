## Level 1: Blueprint (Structural Drawing)
As a developer, you think in boxes and containers. Start by drawing anime characters using **Primitive Shapes**.
- **What to draw:** Head circles, torso boxes, and cylinder limbs.
- **The Dev Connection:** This is exactly like mapping out a **Flexbox** or **Grid** layout before adding CSS. It teaches you that complex UIs (and characters) are just nested boxes.
- **The Challenge:** Draw 5 different "mannequin" poses of your favorite protagonist using only 3D shapes.

# Level 2:  Precision and Control (Line & Weight)
In frontend, `border-width` and `border-radius` define the feel of a component. In anime, **Line Weight** defines the focus.
- **What to draw:** Anime eyes and hair.
- **The Dev Connection:** Practice varying your line thickness. Thick lines for shadows/bottoms of objects; thin lines for highlights/tops. This mirrors how you use `box-shadow` to create depth.
- **The Challenge:** Draw one eye with a "bold" UI feel (thick lines) and one with a "minimalist" feel (whisper-thin lines).
## Level 3: Palette (Color & Shading)
Anime uses "Cell Shading," which is very logical. There are hard edges between light and shadow.
- **What to draw:** Small "icons" or props from anime (e.g., a Naruto kunai, a Pokémon ball, or a One Piece devil fruit).
- **The Dev Connection:** Use a limited palette (like a **Tailwind config**). Pick 3 shades of one color: Base, Highlight, and Shadow.
- **The Challenge:** Color an object using only three hex codes. Focus on where the "light source" is hitting—this will vastly improve how you design buttons and cards.
    
## Level 4: Multi-Perspective
Perspective is just the "Z-index" and "Aspect Ratio" of the physical world
- **What to draw:** Anime background rooms (think Lofi Girl’s desk or a futuristic Cyberpunk street).
- **The Dev Connection:** This helps you understand **Scale** and **Visual Hierarchy**. Which elements should be largest to grab the user's (or viewer's) attention?
- **The Challenge:** Draw a simple desk scene from a "bird's eye view" and then from a "worm's eye view."
