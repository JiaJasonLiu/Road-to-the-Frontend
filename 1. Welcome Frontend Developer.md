This is your second brain where you will store all your frontend developer experience and information in. To both allow you to understand deeply and record all your findings.

# 🧠 Frontend Expert Roadmap

## Phase 1 — Deepen Core Frontend Skills
**Goal:** Move from “using tools” → “understanding how they work.”
### 🔍 JavaScript Mastery
- Event loop, async/await internals, closures, prototypes, modules.
- Functional programming patterns (immutability, pure functions).
- Performance profiling with DevTools.
- Design patterns in JS (factory, observer, module, etc.).
- Deep TypeScript understanding: types, generics, utility types, declaration merging.
### 🔍 TypeScript Mastery
- [[Const]]
- Static Type Checking
- [[Discriminate Unions]]
- [[Conditional Types]]
### 🧰 CSS Mastery
- CSS architecture: **BEM**, **CSS Modules**, **utility-first (Tailwind)**, **CSS-in-JS**.
- Responsive and adaptive design.
- CSS performance (paint, layout thrashing, GPU acceleration).
- Advanced layouts: Grid, Flexbox, `clamp()`, container queries.

---
## Phase 2 — Framework Expertise (React, Vue, etc.)
**Goal:** Understand your framework’s internals and ecosystem.
### 🔍 React Deep Dive
- [[Reconciliation]] and virtual DOM diffing.
- Advanced hooks: `useReducer`, `useMemo`, custom hooks.
- React patterns: compound components, render props, HOCs, context.
- Performance tuning: memoization, lazy loading, suspense, code splitting.
### 🧩 Ecosystem Tools
- Routing: React Router, Next.js.
- State management: Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Recoil, or Signals.
- Forms: React Hook Form, Formik.
- Testing: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress.

---
## Phase 3 — Scalable Frontend Architecture
**Goal:** Write maintainable, large-scale applications.
### 🧱 Key Concepts
- File/folder architecture and modularization.
- Monorepos (Nx, Turborepo).
- Code-splitting and lazy loading.
- Environment configuration for multiple deployments.
- Internationalization (i18n).
### 📦 Component Design
- Design reusable UI libraries or design systems.
- Use Storybook for UI documentation.
- Accessibility (a11y) standards and testing with axe-core.
---
## Phase 4 — Frontend Performance Engineering
**Goal:** Make apps fast and smooth.
### 🧰 Learn To
- Use Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and React Profiler.
- Optimize rendering and bundle sizes.
- Apply lazy loading, prefetching, and compression (Brotli, gzip).
- Master Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, TBT).
- Optimize images, caching, and CDN usage.

---
## Phase 5 — Advanced UX & Design Integration
**Goal:** Bridge design and engineering beautifully.
- Deep Figma skills (auto-layouts, design tokens).
- Motion and micro-interactions (Framer Motion, GSAP).
- UI heuristics and accessibility best practices.
- Implement dark mode, themes, and custom design systems.

---
## Phase 6 — Professional Development Skills
**Goal:** Become a well-rounded engineer who can lead projects.
- Write documentation and establish code standards.
- Mentor others and review PRs effectively.
- Learn testing and CI/CD for frontend.
- Deploy with Vercel, Netlify, or containerized setups.
- Learn Git branching strategies and agile workflows.

---
## Phase 7 — Specialization & Thought Leadership
**Goal:** Stand out as an *expert*, not just a developer.
### Choose an Expertise Path
- Performance optimization (Core Web Vitals, rendering).
- Frontend architecture (large-scale React/Next apps).
- Accessibility and inclusive design.
- Animations and visual design systems.
- TypeScript-heavy engineering.
### Build Credibility
- Write blog posts or tutorials.
- Contribute to open-source libraries.
- Speak or share projects publicly (Twitter, GitHub, DEV.to).
